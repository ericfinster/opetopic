    <h2 class="ui dividing header">Type Theory</h2>

    <p>
      Univalent type theory has uncovered new connections between
      higher dimensional category theory, logic, and computer science.
      Since its inception, three main strands of research have aimed
      at deepening and extending this connection.
    </p>

    <h4 class="ui header">Model Theory</h4>

    <p>
      Soon after introducting the homotopy theoretic interpretation 
      of type theory, Voevodsky, et al, 
      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2851">showed</a> that there was indeed a 
      <em>model</em> of the theory in simplicial sets, which additionally
      satisfied his <em>univalence axiom</em>.  A consequence is that
      theorems proved internally to type theory are in fact theorems about
      homotopy types in the traditional mathematical sense of the word.
    </p>

    <p>
      Various other authors have extended these results, showing that we can
      obtain univalent models in many other categories.
    </p>

    <h4 class="ui header">Computational Theory</h4>

    <p>
      In practice, using univalent type theory has involved adding <em>axioms</em>
      to existing type theories in order to access higher dimensional information.
      The univalence axiom itself, but also <em>higher inductive types</em> must
      be added to proof assistants by hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a type-theoretic perspective, this situation is less than ideal, since
      adding axioms to type theory breaks its computational interpretation: a 
      proof assistant is unable to reduce a term which contains an instance of 
      an axiom, since the simple addition of an axiom does not explain its reduction
      behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/mortberg/cubicaltt">cubical type theory</a> of
      Coquand, Cohen, Huber, and Mortberg, aims at solving this problem.
    </p>

    <h4 class="ui header">Coherence Theory</h4>

    <p>
      As with most investigations into higher category theory, problems
      of coherence have cropped up almost from the beginning.  From an
      internal perspective, the types of univalent type theory behave
      like infinity groupoids, coherent at all levels.  But we cannot
      describe internally what coherence <em>means</em>, since doing
      so requires us to write down types with infinitely many constructors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most work on this problem has focused on finding a reasonable internal
      definition of <em>simplicial type</em>.  The main idea is that axiomatizing
      such an object would allow us to speak of main other kinds of higher 
      coherent objects such as internal groupoids and (infinity, 1)-categories.
      So far, however, no simple solution to this problem has been found.
