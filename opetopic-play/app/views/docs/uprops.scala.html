    <p>
      One of the attractive features of working with opetopic categories
      is that the very definition of an opetopic category is given in 
      terms of what is possibly the most important concept of category
      theory: universal properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we are going to describe two universal properties
      that a cell in an opetopic set might have.  The definitions are 
      mutually coinductive, but we hope this will not scare away too 
      many readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's begin with a cell f as in the previous section.
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/cellctxt.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      We will first introduce notation for the properties we are interested
      in, and then explain what that notation means.  The first property
      is called <em>target universality</em>, and a cell which is target
      universal will be denoted with a small triangle decorating the
      output edge corresponding to its target as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/tgtctxt.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      The second universal property we will be interested in is called
      <em>source universality</em> and depends on the choice of a particular
      source cell of f.  It will similarly be denoted by a small triangle,
      this time decorating the appropriate input edge:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/srcctxt.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the above diagram, we have labelled the input edges with the
      faces they correspond in order to aid the reader in seeing what
      assertion is being made about f by the decoration: by decorating
      the edge corresponding to the cell x, we mean to assert that
      f is source universal at x.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now proceed to the definitions.
    </p>

    <div class="ui top attached inverted grey segment">
      <div class="ui header">Target Universal</div>
    </div>
    <div class="ui middle attached center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/luniv1.svg"></object>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached segment">
      <p>
	Definition: a cell f is said to be <em>target universal</em>
	if for all s and t filling the cells depicted in green, there
	exist u and v completing the diagram such that v both is target
	universal and source universal at u.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Let us pause to make a couple remarks before moving on to the
      definition of source universal.  First of all, the observant
      reader will notice that the shape depicted in the diagram above
      is exactly the target extrusion of f as discussed in the previous
      section.  We have colored the cells in the diagram simply as a
      means to aid the reader in recognizing what are the
      hypotheses of the definition (in green), and what are its
      conclusions (in red).
    </p>

    <p>
      We now finish the definition by explaining what it is for a cell
      f to be source universal at a chosen source cell x.  Not
      surprisingly this definition will make use of the source
      extrusion at x.
    </p>

    <div class="ui top attached inverted grey segment">
      <div class="ui header">Source Universal</div>
    </div>
    <div class="ui middle attached center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/runiv1.svg"></object>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached segment">
      <p>
	Definition: a cell f is said to be <em>source universal</em>
	at a given source cell x if for all s and t filling the cells
	depicted in green, there exist u and v completing the diagram
	such that v is both target universal and source universal at
	u.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      With these two concepts in hand, we can now proceed to the 
      definition of an opetopic category.
