    <p>
      One of the attractive features of working with opetopic categories
      is that the very definition of an opetopic category is given in 
      terms of what is possibly the most important concept of category
      theory: universal properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we are going to describe two universal properties
      that a cell in an opetopic set might have.  The definitions are 
      mutually coinductive, but we hope this will not scare away too 
      many readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's begin with a cell f as in the previous section.
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/cellctxt.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      Our first definition makes use of the target extrusion of f and
      is meant to capture the idea that the cell w is the composite
      of x, y and z with f as a witness to this fact.  It proceeds as
      follows:
    </p>

    <div class="ui top attached inverted grey segment">
      <div class="ui header">Target Universal</div>
    </div>
    <div class="ui middle attached center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/luniv1.svg"></object>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached segment">
      <p>
	Definition: a cell f is said to be <em>target universal</em>
	if for all s and t filling the cells depicted in green, there
	exist u and v completing the diagram such that v both is target
	universal and source universal at u.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Not surprisingly, the definition of source universal will now
      make use of the source extrusion, which recall takes place with
      respect to a selected source cell.
    </p>

    <div class="ui top attached inverted grey segment">
      <div class="ui header">Source Universal</div>
    </div>
    <div class="ui middle attached center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/runiv1.svg"></object>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached segment">
      <p>
	Definition: a cell f is said to be <em>source universal</em>
	at a given source cell x if for all s and t filling the cells
	depicted in green, there exist u and v completing the diagram
	such that v is both target universal and source universal at
	u.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      With these two concepts in hand, we can now proceed to the 
      definition of an opetopic category.
