    <p>
      In this section, we describe how to build opetopes graphically
      using the editor interface which you will find in all the
      applications on this site.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the window below is an editor instance which will all you
      to build an opetope graphically.

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Extrusion</h3>

    <p>
      The most basic technique is call <em>extrusion</em> and 
      consists in enclosing a subtree of cells in a new cell.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Drop Extrusion</h3>
    
    <p>
      The opetopic version of <em>degenerate cells</em> are called
      drops.  The editor has a separate facility for inserting drops.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Prepending a Glob</h3>
    
    <p>
      While the previous two operations work by inserting new
      space on the target side, it is sometimes convenient to 
      insert a new cell on the <em>source</em> side.  We can do
      that by selecting an <em>external</em> cell and asking the
      editor to insert a glob with the chosen cell as its target.
