      Category theory has had a profound effect on modern mathematics.
      Over the years, is has become an indispensible tool in algebra,
      topology, computer science, logic and even physics.  Moreover,
      it has been recognized for some time that the theory of
      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009">
	higher categories</a> is intimately connected to some of the
      most promising lines of modern mathematical research:
      topological quantum field theory, derived algebraic geometry,
      stable homotopy theory, quantum groups and more.  And with the
      introduction of Univalent Type Theory by Voevodsky in 2009, we
      can add logic, computer science and constructive mathematics to
      that list as well<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is dedicated to a certain approach to the theory of
      higher categories based on a collection of shapes called the
      <em>opetopes</em>.  It is probably fair to say that among the
      currently available approaches to higher category theory, the
      opeoptic one is the among least well known.  This is not without
      some justification: indeed, finding a sufficiently rigorous
      definition of the opetopes has occupied a number of different
      authors, and the subtleties involved might leave one with the
      impression that the approach is more trouble than it is worth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps another reason for the perceived difficulty of the
      opetopes can be seen in the table below:
    </p>

    <table class="ui celled large table">
      <thead>
	<tr>
	  <th>Cell Type</th>
	  <th>In Dimension 2</th>
	  <th>In Higher Dimensions</th>
	</tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td>Globular</td>
	  <td>Circle</td>
	  <td>Spheres</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Simplicial</td>
	  <td>Triangle</td>
	  <td>Simplices</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Cubical</td>
	  <td>Square</td>
	  <td>Cubes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Opetopic</td>
	  <td>(Planar) Tree</td>
	  <td>N-Trees</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      While the more direct approaches to higher category theory
      employ cells based on shapes which are exceedingly familiar even
      in higher dimensions, the higher dimensional analogs of trees
      are perhaps less so.  Moreover, there is some flexibility in
      what exactly we mean by higher dimensional tree, and the
      opetopes can be seen as a class of particularly well behaved
      ones.  All the subtleties in the definition of these objects are
      involved in making precise what one means by "well-behaved".
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Why Opetopes?</h3>

    <p>
      So, then, what makes the opetopes worth the effort?
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin to answer that question, let me first observe that one
      of the hallmarks of category theory is the use
      of <em>diagrammatic reasoning</em>, namely, the use of
      commutative diagrams to express equations.  Whatever ontological
      status we grant to these diagrams, it is difficult to deny their
      pragmatic value: it is often times simply more efficient to draw
      a well conceived commutative diagram than to explicitly list a
      collection of equations among maps.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we pass to higher categories, finding reasonable diagrammatic
      representations becomes more challenging.  Certainly the
      literature on 2-categories has a well developed system of
      notation for two-cells, but what about beyond that?  Are we stuck?
    </p>

    <p>
      On this site, we will be developing a systematic way of representing
      an manipulating "opetopic diagrams", and the central thesis can be
      summarized as follows:
    </p>
    
    <div class="ui huge message">
      Opetopic diagrams provide an elementary formal account of diagrammatic
      reasoning which remains valid in all dimensions.
    </div>

    <p>
      So whereas other approaches benefit from their simplicity on the
      semantic side, the opetopic approach benefits from its diversity
      on the <em>syntactic</em> side.
