      The theory of higher categories is playing a more and more
      crucial role in modern mathematics and physics.
      The <em>cobordism hypothesis</em> and its relationship to
      the study of <em>Topological Quantum Field Theories</em> is
      a great indication of the importance of higher categories in 
      physics.  In algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, the 
      study of <em>derived algebraic geometry</em> seems to find
      its nautral home in the theory of higher categories.  And in
      logic, <em>Univalent Type Theory</em> is revealing the natural
      structue of constructive equality as a purely higher categorical
      phenomenon.

      By now, there are many reasonable definitions of the notion of
      weak higher category.  One could say that what is missing
      currently is not any theoretical gap in understanding, which of
      course is not to say that we understand all there is about
      higher category theory.  Rather, I would argue, perhaps one of
      the most important problems facing the theory of higher
      categories is best regarded as an <em>engineering problem</em>.
      That is, we have many plausible answers to the question "What is
      a higher category?".  Arguably the more important question today
      is "How do I <em>work</em> in a higher category?"
