      Category theory has had a profound effect on modern mathematics.
      Over the years, is has become an indispensible tool in algebra,
      topology, computer science, logic and even physics.  Moreover,
      it has been recognized for some time that the theory of
      <em>higher categories</em> is intimately connected to some of
      the most promising lines of modern mathematical research:
      topological quantum field theory, derived algebraic geometry,
      stable homotopy theory, quantum groups and more.  And with the
      introduction of Univalent Type Theory by Voevodsky in 2006(?),
      we can add logic, computer science and constructive mathematics
      to the list as well.

      This site is dedicated to a certain approach to the theory of
      higher categories based on a collection of shapes called the
      <em>opetopes</em>.  Among the known approaches to higher
      category theory, the opetopic approach is perhaps the least well
      known and least well studied.  This is not completely without reason:
      in contrast to theories based on simplices, spheres or cubes, 
      theories in which one has a single, intuitive cell shape in each
      dimension, one already encounters infinitely many opetopes in
      dimension two, leading to a wild zoo of higher dimensional shapes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Why Opetopes?</h3>

    <p>
      There are many other approaches to higher category theory, what
      makes the opetopes a good choice for this kind of project?
    </p>

    <p>
      From a constructive, logical point of view, the opetopes are unique
      in that they can be viewed as a natural diagrammatic way of reasoning
      which works in all dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the main difficulties facing the theory of higher categories
      is the fact that setting up the theory with existing foundational
      systems is an emmense task.  Quite a bit of technical machinery is
      needed in order to prove even the most elementary assertions. The
      goal of this project is to explore the idea that having a direct
      syntax for manipulating higher dimensional pasting diagrams could
      make for a more natural and elementary approach.

    <p>
      One of the attractive features of ordinary category theory is
      the theory of commutative diagrams.  Category theorists learn
      early on how to express their ideas using commutative diagrams,
      and most modern mathematics papers in algebra, topology, category
      theory, logic and more feature these diagrams.  It is probably fair
      to say that a great deal of modern mathematics is written in 
      a combination of English prose and commutative diagrams.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been a number of efforts to set various types of
      formal systems based on commutative diagrams. (Ref ..)  I'll
      mention just three of them here:
    </p>

      <div class="ui large ordered list">
	<div class="item">Q-systems</div>
	<div class="item">Sketches</div>
	<div class="item">Graph based logic</div>
      </div>

    <p>
      All of these systems build on the idea that commutative diagrams
      are certain kinds of graphs, and propose various rules for manipulating
      and making deductions using these graphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, the opetopic approach considers the basic formulas
      to be constructed from <em>trees</em>.  This author feels that
      this is much more inline with out natural idea about sytax as 
      constructed from tree like objects by certain grammar.
