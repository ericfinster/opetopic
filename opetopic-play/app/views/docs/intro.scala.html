      Opetopic is a higher categorical proof assistant.  
    </p>

    <p>
      While on the one hand, one can seen the project of
      building such a thing as a purely technological
      undertaking, there is also a certain philosohpical
      background which motivates such a project.

    <p>
      From a mathematician's perspective, the project of
      building a proof assistant of any sort is often view
      as a kind of technological undertaking independent
      of the doing mathematics.  The advent of Univalent
      Type Theory, however, has placed this subject square
      in the modern search for a reasonable theory of higher
      categories, and it is with this motivation in mind that
      I built Opetopic.

      The theory of higher categories is playing a more and
      more crucial role in modern mathematics and physics.
      The <em>cobordism hypothesis</em> relates higher categoies
      and the theory of manifolds and surgery.  <em>Topological
	Quantum Fields Theories</em> place higher categories as
      the heart of modern phyical inquries.  The study of higher
      anologs of rings, and more generally the issue of <em>coherence</em>
      is an intergral part of modern algebraic topology and algebraic
      geometry.
