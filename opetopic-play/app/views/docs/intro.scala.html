      The theory of higher categories is playing a more and more
      crucial role in modern mathematics and physics.
      The <em>cobordism hypothesis</em> and its relationship to
      the study of <em>Topological Quantum Field Theories</em> is
      a great indication of the importance of higher categories in 
      physics.  In algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, the 
      study of <em>derived algebraic geometry</em> seems to find
      its nautral home in the theory of higher categories.  And in
      logic, <em>Univalent Type Theory</em> is revealing the natural
      structue of constructive equality as a purely higher categorical
      phenomenon.

      By now, there are many reasonable definitions of the notion of
      weak higher category.  One could say that what is missing
      currently is not any theoretical gap in understanding, which of
      course is not to say that we understand all there is about
      higher category theory.  Rather, I would argue, perhaps one of
      the most important problems facing the theory of higher
      categories is best regarded as an <em>engineering problem</em>.
      That is, we have many plausible answers to the question "What is
      a higher category?".  Arguably the more important question today
      is "How do I <em>work</em> in a higher category?"

      It is amusing to note, and has been remarked before, that in the
      wake of the success of the theory of <em>quasicategories</em>, one
      finds after gaining a reasonable familiarity with the theory that
      the fact that higher categories are represented here by simplicial
      sets plays very little role.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is to say, the arguments being used to prove things about
      infinity categories don't seem to rely at all on the fact that we
      have a fixed model in mind.  One can amuse oneself greatly by
      observing the number of lectures which begin along the lines of
      "I'm not going to say what a higher category is, but ....".
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is this such a popular point of view?  And if it doesn't 
      matter what a higher category is, why not?  The problem, as
      I see it, is that we have yet to isolate exactly what are
      the axioms we are using in such a theory.  (Though see
      Riehl/Verity for a good start ...)
