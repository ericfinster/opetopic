      This site is dedicated to a certain approach to the theory of
      higher categories based on a collection of shapes called the
      <em>opetopes</em>.  Among the approaches know to the theory of higher
      categories, it is perhaps one of the least well known, and 
      it is fair to say that it is not in common usage today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of the reason for this, is that a rigorous definition
      of opetopic higher category, at least in the sense of a definition
      given in the language of sets, is both a non-trivial undertaking,
      and at first sight, probably extremely counterintuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The theory of higher categories is playing a more and more
      crucial role in modern mathematics and physics.
      The <em>cobordism hypothesis</em> and its relationship to
      the study of <em>Topological Quantum Field Theories</em> is
      a great indication of the importance of higher categories in 
      physics.  In algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, the 
      study of <em>derived algebraic geometry</em> seems to find
      its nautral home in the theory of higher categories.  And in
      logic, <em>Univalent Type Theory</em> is revealing the natural
      structue of constructive equality as a purely higher categorical
      phenomenon.
    </p>

    <p>
      By now, there are many reasonable definitions of the notion of
      weak higher category.  One could say that what is missing
      currently is not any theoretical gap in understanding, which of
      course is not to say that we understand all there is about
      higher category theory.  Rather, I would argue, perhaps one of
      the most important problems facing the theory of higher
      categories is best regarded as an <em>engineering problem</em>.
      That is, we have many plausible answers to the question "What is
      a higher category?".  Arguably the more important question today
      is "How do I <em>work</em> in a higher category?"
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Why Opetopes?</h3>

    <p>
      There are many other approaches to higher category theory, what
      makes the opetopes a good choice for this kind of project?
    </p>

    <p>
      From a constructive, logical point of view, the opetopes are unique
      in that they can be viewed as a natural diagrammatic way of reasoning
      which works in all dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the main difficulties facing the theory of higher categories
      is the fact that setting up the theory with existing foundational
      systems is an emmense task.  Quite a bit of technical machinery is
      needed in order to prove even the most elementary assertions. The
      goal of this project is to explore the idea that having a direct
      syntax for manipulating higher dimensional pasting diagrams could
      make for a more natural and elementary approach.
    </p>
	 
    <p>
      One of the attractive features of ordinary category theory is
      the theory of commutative diagrams.  Category theorists learn
      early on how to express their ideas using commutative diagrams,
      and most modern mathematics papers in algebra, topology, category
      theory, logic and more feature these diagrams.  It is probably fair
      to say that a great deal of modern mathematics is written in 
      a combination of English prose and commutative diagrams.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been a number of efforts to set various types of
      formal systems based on commutative diagrams. (Ref ..)  I'll
      mention just three of them here:
    </p>

      <div class="ui large ordered list">
	<div class="item">Q-systems</div>
	<div class="item">Sketches</div>
	<div class="item">Graph based logic</div>
      </div>

    <p>
      All of these systems build on the idea that commutative diagrams
      are certain kinds of graphs, and propose various rules for manipulating
      and making deductions using these graphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, the opetopic approach considers the basic formulas
      to be constructed from <em>trees</em>.  This author feels that
      this is much more inline with out natural idea about sytax as 
      constructed from tree like objects by certain grammar.
