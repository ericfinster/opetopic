      We will say that an opetopic set is an <em>opetopic category</em>
      if the following two conditions are satisfied:

	universal.

	For any target universal cell, if all but one face is also target
	universal, so is the remaining one.  In the above schematic example,

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Comparison with Baez-Dolan Opetopic Categories</h3>

    <p>
      We note that the second axiom here is strengthened with respect
      to that given by Baez and Dolan in
      their <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9702014">original
      definition</a>.  Their definition requires only that composites
      of target universals are also target universal, that is, they
      require our axiom only in the case where it is the cell w 
      which is not already known to be target universal, as depicted
      by the following diagram:
    </p>

    <p>
      Readers familiar with model categories will recognize this as
      an opetopic adaptation of the 2-for-3 axiom of equivalences 
      in a model category.  We think this makes the axiom reasonable
      from a theoretical point of view.  In compensation for this 
      strengthening of the axioms for a category, our definition of
      universal properties are weaker that those given by Baez-Dolan.
      We will show later that under this stronger definition of category,
      we can recover the full strength of Baez-Dolan style universal cells.
