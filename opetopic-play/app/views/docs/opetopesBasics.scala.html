    <p>
      As mentioned in the introduction, opetopes can be seen as
      certain well-formed higher dimensional trees.  It may not be
      surprising, therefore, that we begin by fixing some notation for
      trees.  In particular, opetopic diagrams arise from the
      interaction of two methods for depicting a tree.  An example of
      each of these methods is shown in the following diagram:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/boxtree.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      As will become clear upon inspection, both diagrams represent
      the same rooted tree.  The picture on the right is probably the
      more familiar: the tree is depicted as a <em>graph</em> with
      nodes and edges.  The digarm on the left, by contrast, depicts
      the tree structure using a collection of boxes, with the
      containment of the boxes specifying the descendent ordering. The
      correspondence between the two can be summarized by noticing
      that we have a bijection between the <em>boxes</em> on the left,
      and the <em>edges</em> on the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now consider the following diagram which, unlike the previous, is
      not a picture of the same tree in two ways, but rather a picture
      of <em>two different</em> trees combined into a single diagram.
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/nesting.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      On the one hand, we have the tree defined by the containment of
      the boxes, and on the other, the tree determined by the edges.
      Observe that the boxes marked a, b, and c play a dual role: they
      are both the "leaves" of the tree formed by the boxes (since
      they contain no boxes themselves), while at the same time
      we are using them to serve as the "nodes" for the tree determined
      by the edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, consider the following:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/newzoom.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      It may seem intuitively that, since each diagram depicts two trees
      simulataneously, that the above diagram depicts four.  But in fact,
      there are only three trees here: the reason is that the edge tree
      in the right diagram is isomorphic to the box tree in the left
      diagram.
