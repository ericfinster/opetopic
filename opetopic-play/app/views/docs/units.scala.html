    <p>
      Let us start with an object x in an opetopic category.
    </p>

    @svg("units/x-def.svg")

    <p>
      Then there is a canonical pasting diagram, the empty pasting diagram
      on x, which is represented by the trivial tree in dimension 1.  This
      pasting diagram is depicted as follows:
    </p>

    @svg("units/x-paste.svg")

    <p>
      According to the first axiom of an opetopic category, this diagram 
      admits a target universal filler which looks as follows:
    </p>

    @svg("units/id-x-def.svg")

    <p>
      Moreover, applying the second axiom of an opetopic category, we learn
      that in fact, the composite, which we have called id-x, is in fact itself
      target universal.
    </p>

    @svg("units/id-univ.svg")

    <p>
      In order to justify that the cell obtained in this manner behaves as an
      identity, let us suppose that we have an arrow f with source x:
    </p>

    @svg("units/f-def.svg")

    <p>
      We may then form the composite of f and id-x as follows:
    </p>

    @svg("units/f-comp-id.svg")

    <p>
      If we now compose α with the filler obtained in the definition
      of id-x, we obtain the following:
    </p>

    @svg("units/unit-r-def.svg")

    <p>
      Where the left universality of the resulting cell follows from
      the closure of target universal cells under composition.  Taking
      a look at the resulting cell, we see that we have constructed a
      left universal cell connecting f and f ∘ id-x, whose shape is 
      simply that of a 2-glob:
    </p>

    @svg("units/unit-r.svg")

    <p>
      We interpret this cell as the right unit law of our higher
      category.  In the next section, we will justify the intuition
      that this cell is in fact an <em>equivalence</em> between f and
      f ∘ id-x.
