    <p>
      We will be interested in this section in two constructions
      which can be made on an arbitrary cell, embedding it in
      a diagram of the next higher dimension. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We first fix some notation.  Consider the diagram below:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/head.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      Recall that according to our definition, an opetope must
      finish with a single cell in the top dimension.  In view of
      the bonding relationship, this implies that the codimension 1
      part of the diagram consists of a single box, the target of
      the cell, as well as an arbitrary tree consisting of its sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will refer to the top dimensional cell, together with its
      codimension 1 part as the <em>head</em> of the diagram as
      indicated.  Moreover, to depict a cell of arbitrary dimension,
      we will depict just the head, using an ellipsis to denote
      the lower dimensional part.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the above considerations established, the following is
      meant to indicate a cell f of some arbitrary dimension with
      its codimension 1 faces depicted as well.
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/cellctxt.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      Notice that we must chose <em>some</em> tree in our diagram to 
      serve as the source tree for the cell f, but it will be clear
      from what follows that our constructions do not depend in any
      way on the shape of this tree.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Left Extension</h3>

    <p>
      Our first construction is called left extension and is 
      demonstrated in the interactive display below.
    </p>

    <div class="ui attached center aligned segment">
      <svg width="360" height="175" id="lext-svg"></svg>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached center aligned segment">
      <div class="ui small steps">
	<a class="active step" id="start-left">Start</a>
	<a class="step" id="extrude-left">Extrude</a>
	<a class="step" id="enclose-left">Enclose</a>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Notice that the extension consists of two steps: first,
      enclose the target in a new box, modifying the edge tree
      of the next dimension to accomodate the bonding relation.
      Next, enclose the remaining tree and add a new top dimensional
      cell.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Right Extension</h3>

    <p>
      Right extensions are similar, but work with respect to
      a given source cell.  In the following demonstration,
      we perform a "right extension at x".  It should be clear
      that the same construction can be applied equally well
      to any other chosen source face.
    </p>

    <div class="ui attached center aligned segment">
      <svg width="360" height="175" id="rext-svg"></svg>
    </div>
    <div class="ui bottom attached center aligned segment">
      <div class="ui small steps">
	<a class="active step" id="start-right">Start</a>
	<a class="step" id="extrude-right">Extrude</a>
	<a class="step" id="enclose-right">Enclose</a>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Observe that in the right extension, we add a new
      cell "above" the chosen source face, adding a new
      cell as a descendant of our original, and then 
      enclosing the structure with the appropriate shape.
