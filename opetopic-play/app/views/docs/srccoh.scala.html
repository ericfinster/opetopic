      Our goal in this section is to prove the following:
    </p>

    <div class="ui top attached inverted grey segment">
      <div class="ui header">Proposition</div>

    <div class="ui bottom attached segment">

	Consider a cell f which is both target universal and
	source universal at a face x.
      </p>

      @svg("srccoh/f-def.svg")

      <p>
	Then for any competitor u of x and g a target
	target universal cell, as in the diagram
      </p>

      @svg("srccoh/g-univ.svg")

      <p>
	Then in fact, g is source universal at u.

    <p>
      First construct the cell α using the source lifting
      property of f:
    </p>
    
    @svg("srccoh/alpha-def.svg")

    <p>
      Observe that α is target universal by closure.  Now, suppose we
      are given s and t, a lifting problem as shown in the following
      diagram:
    </p>

    @svg("srccoh/goal.svg")

    <p>
      Our goal is to fill the orange boxes and show the appropriate
      universal properties.  We first use the universal property of
      f to obtain the cell β as depicted.
    </p>

    @svg("srccoh/beta-def.svg")

    <p>
      Composing β and α-inv we obtain the cell γ.
    </p>

    @svg("srccoh/gamma-def.svg")

    <p>
      All I can see to do now is compose everything to obtain δ:
    </p>

    @svg("srccoh/delta-def.svg")

    <p>
      Actually, maybe the following is better:
    </p>

    @svg("srccoh/epsilon-def.svg")

    <p>
      From here, you have a bit of work, but it seems pretty likely
      that α and α-inv can be cancelled, resulting in just f and
      β as the exterior.  The result should now be that t, being
      universal for this configuation admits a map to/from g ∘ γ.
