    <p>
      Unlike many other types of shapes for higher category theory,
      which are often simple, having a single representative in each
      dimension, there are many, many opetopes.  This complicates
      the task of giving a rigorous set-theoretic definition, and
      there have been a number of attempts and revisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as compensation for their complexity, the opetopes
      have an extremely natural diagrammatic representation.  In my
      opinon, this representation is the most direct way to understand
      what the opetopes are, and why they are useful.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Consequently, we will approach the opetopes diagrammatically,
      illustrating how we can build them by some very simple rules.
      This will be sufficient for all the applications on this site.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key to understanding opetope diagrams is to understand 
      the following two representations of the same tree:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      @docs.svgs.boxtree()
    </div>

    <p>
      Both diagrams represent the same structure: a rooted tree.  However,
      in each of the two cases, the information about this structure is
      presented differently.  The picture on the right is probably more
      familiar: the tree is depicted as a <em>graph</em> with nodes 
      and edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the left, we have presented the same tree, but where the tree
      structure is now described by the <em>nesting</em> of the
      boxes, one inside another.  The pattern is simple: the descendents
      of a given edge are exactly the boxes it contains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The power of opetopic diagrams will come from combining these two
      different representations at the same time to represent higher
      dimensional informaion.

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">A First Example</h3>

    <p>
      Look at the opetopic diagram below.  This diagram is interactive
      in the sense that as you pass your mouse cursor over each of the
      boxes, it will highlight all the cells that are faces of the
      one you are pointing at.
    </p>

    <div class="ui grid">
      <div class="sixteen wide center aligned column" id="gallery-pane">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      For example, hovering over any of the boxes in dimension one, i.e.
      any of the arrows, highlights that arrows source and target, which
      are zero dimensional cells.
