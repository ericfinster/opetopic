      Here, again, is the complex we were looking at at the end
      of the last section:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/bigcomplex.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      Notice that there are two trees here which are, in a sense,
      unconstrained: the edge tree of the left-hand diagram, and the
      box tree of the right.  On the left, this is simply because
      there is no diagram which "comes before" whose boxes would fix
      the structure of the edge tree.  Similarly, on the right, there
      is no diagram which "comes after" whose edges would fix the
      structure of the boxes. We could have equally well drawn a
      different collection of edges on the left, and a different
      collection of boxes on the right without affecting the bonding
      relationship between the adjacent pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to single out the opetopes among all possible
      complexes, we are going to fix these two ambiguities by
      specifying an initial and final condition.  Hence we will say
      that an unlabeled opetopic complex is an <em>opetope</em> if
    </p>

    <div class="ui message">
      <div class="ui big ordered list">
	<div class="item">The initial box tree is <em>linear</em></div>
	<div class="item">The final box tree is <em>trivial</em>, that is, consists of only the root</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      For example, the following complex is an opetope:
    </p>

    <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/svgs/opetope.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>
      In fact, by demanding that the initial box tree be linear, we remove
      the need for the edges entirely, and hence, as shown above, we will
      simply leave them off since they do not correspond to any previous
      boxes.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In an opetope, each atomic diagram can be assigned a dimension,
      starting on the left and beginning with zero.  Consequently, the
      above opetope is 5-dimensional.  As we will see below, each box
      in the diagram itself corresponds to an opetope, and so we will
      often refer to the boxes generically as <em>cells</em>.  When a
      particular opetope is under discussion, we will occasionally refer
      to the cells which comprise it as its <em>faces</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Notice that, in view of our definition, each face
      appears <em>exactly twice</em> in the diagram: once in its
      proper dimension, and once in the following dimension as the
      edge which it corresponds to under the bond. This makes good
      geometric sense.  Indeed, we expect an (n+1)-dimensional object
      to have a boundary which is n-dimensional and as we will see,
      the boundary of any one of our cells is easy to describe: 
      for an (n+1)-dimensional cell, its boundary consists of exactly
      the n-cells corresponding to the edges which intersect the 
      boundary of the box which represents it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This observation provides us with a nice interpretation of what
      our atomic diagrams in fact depict: the boxes of an (positive dimensional)
      atomic diagram depict a collection of cells, while the edges
      are a picture of how these cells are glued together along cells
      of codimension 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as any face of a higher dimensional simplex is itself a
      simplex, and that of a higher dimensional cube a cube, every
      face of an opetope is also an opetope.  The following
      interactive demonstration will serve to illustrate this point:
    </p>
    
    <div class="ui top attached segment">
      <h3 class="ui header">Opetope</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ui attached center aligned segment">
      <div id="gallery-pane"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="ui top attached segment">
      <h3 class="ui header">Face</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ui attached center aligned segment">
      <div id="face-pane"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      First of all, as you pass your mouse cursor over one of the cells,
      you will notice that a number of lower dimensional cells are highlighted.
      These are exactly the faces of the face you are pointing at.  Futhermore
      if you click on one of the faces, its opetopic structure will be 
      "extracted" into the bottom region, where you can verify that it also
      is an opetope in the sense defined above.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ui dividing header">Constructing Opetopes Inductively</h3>

    <p>
      Our description of the opetopes provides a straightforward
      recipe for constructing them.  Start with a finite, linear
      nesting of boxes.  Draw the edge tree which corresponds to that
      nesting.  Add boxes to taste, ensuring that there is a largest
      box enclosing all the others.  Repeat.
